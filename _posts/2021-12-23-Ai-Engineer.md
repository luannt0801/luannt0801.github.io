Roadmap to Senior AI/ML Engineer
(with LLMs + MLOps + Systems)
Python → NumPy → Pandas → Matplotlib
→ Scikit-learn → Data Cleaning & EDA
→ Stats & Probability → Linear Algebra → Calculus
→ ML Algorithms (Regression, Trees, SVMs, KNN, Clustering)
→ Deep Learning (ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GANs)
→ PyTorch / TensorFlow → Transfer Learning → Fine-tuning
→ Hugging Face Transformers → LangChain / LlamaIndex
→ LLM Internals (Tokenization, Attention, BPE, KV Cache)
